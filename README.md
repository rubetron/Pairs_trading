# Pairs_trading
Python implementation of the pairs trading strategy in Gatev, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst (2006). I am not the author of that study; this is an independent replication.

This notebook replicates the pairs trading model of [Gatev, Goetzmann and Rouwenhorst (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhj020) in Python. I used similar pairs trading strategies in my paper [The Long and the Short of Risk Parity](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijpormgmt/early/2022/01/26/jpm20221333), although the backtesting implementation in that paper is a bit more realistic and was done in Matlab. I had previously written an article with an R implementation, which can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/arubesam/ReplicatingGGR). The .py files in the [github for this project](https://github.com/rubetron/Pairs_trading) are more suitable if you want to explore the code directly in Python. It contains the same functionalities but with more clear function separation. It also doesn't include any analysis.*
